        <h1>Brooke Sexton</h1>

        <p> I am currently a student at Towson University. 
            I am enrolled in the Jess and Mildred Fisher College of Science and Mathematics. 
            I am studying computer science and am expected to graduate with a bachelor of science in the spring of 2026. 
            While going to school, I work part-time at the National Security Agency as a office manager, a role that I have held for around three and a half years.
        </p>
